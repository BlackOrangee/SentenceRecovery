# SentenceRecovery

1. Launch:

    Run bin\Debug\net8.0\SentenceRecovery.exe
  
    Or bin\Release\net8.0\SentenceRecovery.exe

    Or open as a project using SentenceRecovery.sln.

    The input file "source.txt" should be located next to "SentenceRecovery.exe".
  
    The output file is "result.txt".
   

  
3. Description:
   
    This tool implements an approach for automatic recovery of concatenated or corrupted text using

      splitting the input string into overlapping chunks
   
      recursive processing of each chunk using a dictionary;
   
      combining results based on quality (number of words + weighted score).
   

    Candidate quality is evaluated using word and phrase frequency data from external corpora:
  
      SUBTLEXus (subtitle word frequencies):
   
        https://www.ugent.be/pp/experimentele-psychologie/en/research/documents/subtlexus
    
      Google Books Ngram (massive frequency data from books):
   
        https://github.com/orgtre/google-books-ngram-frequency/tree/main/ngrams


4. Note:
   
   The following initial string for recovery is not valid, as it violates the declared task rules (insertions are indicated with arrows)
   
     Rules:
   
      Some letters are replaced with the * symbol (1 asterisk = 1 letter);
   
      In some words, letters are randomly shuffled;
   
      All spaces and punctuation marks have been removed.

   Alice was beginning to get very  tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice  she had peeped
                                 |                                     |                                             |      |   |
                                 v                                     v                                             v      v   v

   into the book her sister was reading but it  had no pictures or conversations  in it and what is the use of a book thought Alice without pictures or conversations
               |  |                          |                      |
               v  v                          v                      v

```

   Thatâ€™s why I used the corrected string:
```
